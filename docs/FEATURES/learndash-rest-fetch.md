# LearnDash Courses REST Fetch (Deprecated)

This console-only REST fetch path was removed after migrating courses to WPGraphQL.

## Status
- Deprecated/removed. REST env vars and services/hooks were deleted.
- Courses now load via WPGraphQL through `coursesService` and related hooks/pages.

## Action
- Use the GraphQL-based course fetching; do not add REST calls or env vars for courses.
